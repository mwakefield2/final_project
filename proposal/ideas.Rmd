## Section 1. Introduction

So the Data set that i choose to work with is the weather in tampa. I chose this data set because I live in the tampa bay area

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

Some initial questions that I plan to explore in this project are:
- What is the average temp in each month?
- Which month has the highest precipitation?
- When is it the best time to travel to tampa based on the weather?

## Section 3. Data

The dataset I choose is linked here <https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/tpa_weather_16_17.csv>. This data was taken everyday during 2016-2017. The data records the max temp, min temp and the precipitation.
